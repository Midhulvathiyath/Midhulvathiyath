## About me
I'm a practical, hands-on cybersecurity practitioner and bug bounty researcher with an ISAC NSD certification. I focus on vulnerability discovery, responsible disclosure, and improving security posture for web applications, APIs and cloud-hosted services. I enjoy automating security workflows, participating in CTFs, and building tools that help defenders and researchers alike.

## Highlights
- 🎓 **ISAC NSD Certified Bug Bounty Researcher**  
- 🐞 Experienced in bug bounty platforms and responsible disclosure  
- 🧰 Skilled with offensive security tooling and recon/OSINT techniques  
- ⚙️ Built automation & deployment tooling (Vagrant + Docker honeypot generator)  
- 🌱 Active in CTFs, community learning, and continuous skill development

---

## Skills & Tools
**Testing / Recon / Offense**
- Web & API testing (OWASP Top 10 mindset)
- Recon & attack surface mapping
- Exploit verification & PoC development

**Tools**
- Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, curl, wfuzz
- OSINT & enumeration frameworks
- Docker, Vagrant, iptables, Snort (for honeypot/navigation)

**Cloud & Networking**
- Cloud fundamentals and deployment models
- Networking concepts, packet redirection and IDS/IPS basics

---

## Selected Projects
### Honeypot Generator (Vagrant + Docker)
Automates deployment of honeypot systems using Vagrant and Docker. Routes and redirects traffic with `iptables` and integrates Snort for intrusion detection and logging. Useful for threat-intel collection, red-team simulations, and research.

**Key features**
- Automated VM provisioning with Vagrant
- Dockerized services to simulate real-world targets
- Dynamic packet redirection and Snort integration
- Logging & analysis-ready outputs

### Bug Bounty & Vulnerability Research
Ongoing participation in multiple bug bounty programs. Focused on web app and API vulnerabilities, responsible disclosure, and producing clear, actionable reports for remediation.

### Teaching / Content
Prepared learning materials and MCQs on:
- Computer networks (OSI/TCP-IP, transport layers)
- Cloud computing fundamentals, deployment models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS)
- EIA modules and environmental impact assessment topics (education-focused content)

---

## How I work
- Follow responsible disclosure and coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) practices.  
- Reproduce and verify issues with clear PoC, remediation steps and risk classification.  
- Prefer automation (scripts & containers) to speed up repeatable tasks and tests.

---

## What I'm looking for
- Bug bounty engagements and responsible disclosure opportunities.  
- Collaboration on open-source security tools and honeypot / threat-intel projects.  
- Learning and mentorship relationships in advanced exploitation & defensive engineering.
